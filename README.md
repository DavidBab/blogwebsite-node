## About

This web app is built with `Express` and `Node.js`. The entire website is designed using EJS templates to enhance efficiency and reduce code complexity. It uses JSON documents to store posts and other information, such as post ID.

## How to Use the App?

Itâ€™s simple! If you want to create a post, navigate to `{url}/post` or just click on the "Post" section in the navigation bar. To view a post, click the button next to the post you want to see or navigate to `{url}/post/id={the post ID you want to view}`. The server side is well documented, so you can have a go and change some things to your own prefrence.

There is also a contact page that stores the submitted information in the contacts.json document, which can be accessed for reading. However, there is no user interface for directly viewing the contents of contacts.json.
